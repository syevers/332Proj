Database connection is in 'db_connection.php'
define('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'localhost');
define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
define('DB_NAME', 'aem');


You might need to set 'localhost' to the name of your profile that you're logged into if the database connection is not working.


If that doesn't work, create a user account in phpMyAdmin with the username 'localhost' and the host name '127.0.0.1'
